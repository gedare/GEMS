    This file is part of Garnet (Princeton's interconnect model),
    a component of the Multifacet GEMS (General Execution-driven 
    Multiprocessor Simulator) software toolset originally developed at 
    the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

    Garnet was developed by Niket Agarwal at Princeton University. Orion was
    developed by Princeton University.

    Substantial further development of Multifacet GEMS at the
    University of Wisconsin was performed by Alaa Alameldeen, Brad
    Beckmann, Jayaram Bobba, Ross Dickson, Dan Gibson, Pacia Harper,
    Derek Hower, Milo Martin, Michael Marty, Carl Mauer, Michelle Moravan,
    Kevin Moore, Andrew Phelps, Manoj Plakal, Daniel Sorin, Haris Volos,
