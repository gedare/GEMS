    This file is part of the SLICC (Specification Language for
    Implementing Cache Coherence), a component of the Multifacet GEMS
    (General Execution-driven Multiprocessor Simulator) software
    toolset originally developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
                                                                                
    SLICC was originally developed by Milo Martin with substantial
    contributions from Daniel Sorin.

    Substantial further development of Multifacet GEMS at the
    University of Wisconsin was performed by Alaa Alameldeen, Brad
    Beckmann, Jayaram Bobba, Ross Dickson, Dan Gibson, Pacia Harper,
    Derek Hower, Milo Martin, Michael Marty, Carl Mauer, Michelle Moravan,
    Kevin Moore, Manoj Plakal, Daniel Sorin, Haris Volos, Min Xu, and Luke Yen.
