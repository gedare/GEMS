    This file is part of the Ruby Multiprocessor Memory System Simulator, 
    a component of the Multifacet GEMS (General Execution-driven 
    Multiprocessor Simulator) software toolset originally developed at 
    the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

    Ruby was originally developed primarily by Milo Martin and Daniel
    Sorin with contributions from Ross Dickson, Carl Mauer, and Manoj
    Plakal.

    Substantial further development of Multifacet GEMS at the
    University of Wisconsin was performed by Alaa Alameldeen, Brad
    Beckmann, Jayaram Bobba, Ross Dickson, Dan Gibson, Pacia Harper,
    Derek Hower, Milo Martin, Michael Marty, Carl Mauer, Michelle Moravan,
    Kevin Moore, Manoj Plakal, Daniel Sorin, Haris Volos, Min Xu, and Luke Yen.
