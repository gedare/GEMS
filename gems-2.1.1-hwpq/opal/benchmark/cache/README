This directory contains micro-benchmarks to stress opal's two
level cache implementation. These u-benchmarks will be used
with simics/opal simulation. And the simulated cache status
should match the expected results given long enough time of
simulation.

The script "ubenchmark.simics" and "ubenchmark.py" are for creating
simics checkpoint base on the ubenchmark's binary file.
